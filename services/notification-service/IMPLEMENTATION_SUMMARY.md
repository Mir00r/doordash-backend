# Notification Service Implementation Summary

## Overview

The Notification Service is a comprehensive microservice designed to handle all types of notifications in the DoorDash-like platform. It provides multi-channel notification delivery through email, SMS, push notifications, WebSocket, and in-app notifications.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Core Domain Model
- **Notification Entity**: Central entity for managing notifications with status tracking
- **NotificationTemplate**: Template management for reusable notification content
- **UserNotificationPreference**: User-specific notification preferences and settings
- **NotificationDeliveryLog**: Detailed tracking of delivery attempts and outcomes
- **NotificationEvent**: Analytics and engagement tracking
- **DeviceToken**: Push notification device token management

### 2. Multi-Channel Notification Support
- **Email Notifications**: Via SendGrid and SMTP providers
- **SMS Notifications**: Via Twilio
- **Push Notifications**: Via Firebase FCM
- **WebSocket Notifications**: Real-time updates using STOMP
- **In-App Notifications**: Application-specific messaging

### 3. Template Engine
- Dynamic content generation using variable substitution
- Template versioning and management
- Template validation and variable extraction
- Support for multiple template types (EMAIL, SMS, PUSH, IN_APP)

### 4. Event-Driven Architecture
- Kafka integration for processing events from other services
- Automatic notification triggering based on business events
- Support for order, delivery, payment, and user events
- Retry mechanisms with backoff strategies

### 5. User Preference Management
- Granular notification preferences per user
- Quiet hours support
- Channel-specific preferences (email, SMS, push, in-app)
- Marketing and promotional notification controls

### 6. Real-Time Communication
- WebSocket support for live notifications
- STOMP messaging protocol
- User-specific and broadcast messaging
- Heartbeat and connection management

### 7. Analytics and Tracking
- Delivery status tracking
- Engagement metrics (opens, clicks, bounces)
- Provider performance monitoring
- User interaction analytics

### 8. Security and Authorization
- JWT-based authentication
- Role-based access control (USER, ADMIN, SYSTEM)
- Method-level security annotations
- Secure WebSocket connections

### 9. Scalability and Performance
- Asynchronous processing
- Redis caching for rate limiting
- Connection pooling for databases
- Circuit breaker patterns for external services

### 10. Monitoring and Observability
- Actuator endpoints for health checks
- Prometheus metrics integration
- Structured logging with correlation IDs
- OpenAPI documentation with Swagger UI

## Architecture Components

### Data Layer
- PostgreSQL as primary database
- Redis for caching and rate limiting
- Flyway for database migrations
- JPA/Hibernate for ORM

### Service Layer
- Service interfaces with clean separation of concerns
- Provider abstraction for notification delivery
- Template processing and variable substitution
- User preference validation

### Integration Layer
- Kafka consumers for event processing
- RESTful APIs for service communication
- WebSocket endpoints for real-time features
- Webhook support for provider callbacks

### Configuration
- Spring Boot configuration properties
- Environment-specific configurations
- Security configuration
- WebSocket and Kafka configuration

## API Endpoints

### Notification Management
- `POST /notifications` - Create and send notification
- `POST /notifications/draft` - Create notification without sending
- `POST /notifications/bulk` - Send bulk notifications
- `POST /notifications/{id}/send` - Send draft notification
- `POST /notifications/{id}/cancel` - Cancel scheduled notification
- `POST /notifications/{id}/retry` - Retry failed notification
- `GET /notifications/{id}` - Get notification details
- `GET /notifications/user/{userId}` - Get user notifications
- `GET /notifications/status/{status}` - Get notifications by status

### Analytics and Statistics
- `GET /notifications/user/{userId}/stats` - User notification statistics
- `GET /notifications/stats` - System-wide statistics
- `GET /notifications/user/{userId}/unread-count` - Unread notification count

### WebSocket Endpoints
- `/ws` - WebSocket connection endpoint
- `/app/notifications/subscribe/{userId}` - Subscribe to user notifications
- `/topic/notifications/{userId}` - User-specific notification topic

## Database Schema

### Core Tables
- `notifications` - Main notification records
- `notification_templates` - Template definitions
- `user_notification_preferences` - User preferences
- `notification_delivery_logs` - Delivery tracking
- `notification_events` - Analytics events
- `device_tokens` - Push notification tokens
- `notification_batches` - Bulk operation tracking

### Indexes and Performance
- Optimized indexes for common query patterns
- Partitioning strategy for large tables
- Automatic cleanup of old records

## Event Processing

### Supported Events
- **Order Events**: ORDER_CONFIRMED, ORDER_PREPARING, ORDER_READY, ORDER_OUT_FOR_DELIVERY, ORDER_DELIVERED
- **Delivery Events**: DRIVER_ASSIGNED, DRIVER_ARRIVED, DELIVERY_IN_PROGRESS, DELIVERY_COMPLETED
- **Payment Events**: PAYMENT_PROCESSED, PAYMENT_FAILED, REFUND_PROCESSED
- **User Events**: USER_REGISTERED, PASSWORD_RESET_REQUESTED, EMAIL_VERIFICATION_REQUESTED

### Event Processing Features
- Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- Dead letter queue for failed events
- Event correlation and tracking
- Idempotent processing

## Configuration Management

### External Provider Configuration
- SendGrid API integration
- Twilio SMS integration
- Firebase FCM integration
- SMTP server configuration

### Rate Limiting
- Configurable rate limits per channel
- Redis-based rate limiting
- User-specific and global limits

### Circuit Breakers
- Provider-specific circuit breakers
- Automatic fallback mechanisms
- Health monitoring

## Testing Strategy

### Test Coverage
- Unit tests for service layer
- Integration tests for controllers
- Repository tests with test containers
