- Spatial indexes for performance
- Distance and containment queries

## Configuration

### Application Properties
```yaml
server:
  port: 8083
  
spring:
  datasource:
    url: jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/delivery_service
    username: delivery_user
    password: ${DB_PASSWORD}
  
  jpa:
    database-platform: org.hibernate.spatial.dialect.postgis.PostgisDialect
    hibernate:
      ddl-auto: validate
    
  kafka:
    bootstrap-servers: localhost:9092
    
  redis:
    host: localhost
    port: 6379
```

### Security Configuration
- JWT secret and expiration
